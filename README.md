# Neuroeconomics-Gambling-Task

This is a compilation of E-basic code to be added to in-line scripts within the E-prime environment to build a card gambling task. 
In the card gambling task, either 1, 3, or 5 cards are randomly selected out of a possible 8 cards and presented to the participant. the participant can then decide to Accept or Reject the gamble based on the number of cards selected (1, 3, or 5). If a participant accepts the gamble, the point values for the selected cards are totaled and presented to the participant as points won (or lost) for that gamble. If a participant rejects the gamble,the point values for the selected cards are totaled and presented to the participant as points could have won (or lost) for that gamble.

The functions in this repository (1) assign and randomize point values to cards, (2) total point values of cards selected for each gamble, and (3) create jittered ITI's for stimulus presentation.
